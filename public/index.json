But it is my first experience in developing a package, and I really can’t resist to publish it to test some features from devtools, usethis, and pkgdown. To be honest, this is also the sole reason a started this blog–which give me a perfect excuse to try blogdown. I will share some of my experiences in using those package in this blog 😄.\nAt the moment I’m posting this, I’m still building some vignettes for kerasgenerator. As soon as it this finished, I will upload the link in the package website. I’m also developing some other features:\n Support for generating data from file in specified path Support for incorporating recipes package for data preprocessing Data generator for k-shot learning model fitting  If you interested in the package, please stay tuned on this blog for further post related to this package. Also don’t forget to check the package’s website and push the star buttons on the package GitHub repository 😁\nHappy new year!\n","date":1546091760,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546091760,"objectID":"5d1349c3997a65fa271f1a748ed9cdc5","permalink":"/post/kerasgenerator-v0-0-1-released/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T11:56:00+70:00","relpermalink":"/post/kerasgenerator-v0-0-1-released/","section":"post","summary":"kerasgenerator package is designed to simplify the process of preparing the dataset so it could be properly passed to keras’ fit, evaluate, or predict on generator functions.\nCurrently, it is still in a very early development stage–it is even only have 2 functions right now 😁.
