`kerasgenerator` package is designed to simplify the process of preparing the dataset so it could be properly passed to [`keras`](https://keras.rstudio.com)' fit, evaluate, or predict on generator functions.

Currently, it is still in a very early development stage--it is even only have 2 functions right now `r emo::ji("grin")`. But it is my first experience in developing a package, and I really can't resist to publish it to test some features from [`devtools`](https://devtools.r-lib.org/), [`usethis`](https://usethis.r-lib.org/), and [`pkgdown`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/). To be honest, this is also the sole reason a started this blog--which give me a perfect excuse to try [`blogdown`](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown). I will share some of my experiences in using those package in this blog `r emo::ji("smile")`.

At the moment I'm posting this, I'm still building some vignettes for `kerasgenerator`. As soon as it this finished, I will upload the link in the package website. I'm also developing some other features:

- Support for generating data from **file in specified path**
- Support for incorporating [`recipes`](https://tidymodels.github.io/recipes/) package for **data preprocessing**
- Data generator for **k-shot learning** model fitting

If you interested in the package, please stay tuned on this blog for further post related to this package. Also don't forget to check the package's [website](https://kerasgenerator.netlify.com/) and push the star buttons on the package [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bagasbgy/kerasgenerator/) `r emo::ji("grin")`

Happy new year!
