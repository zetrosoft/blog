<p><code>kerasgenerator</code> package is designed to simplify the process of preparing the dataset so it could be properly passed to <a href="https://keras.rstudio.com"><code>keras</code></a>’ fit, evaluate, or predict on generator functions.</p>
<p>Currently, it is still in a very early development stage–it is even only have 2 functions right now 😁. But it is my first experience in developing a package, and I really can’t resist to publish it to test some features from <a href="https://devtools.r-lib.org/"><code>devtools</code></a>, <a href="https://usethis.r-lib.org/"><code>usethis</code></a>, and <a href="https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/"><code>pkgdown</code></a>. To be honest, this is also the sole reason a started this blog–which give me a perfect excuse to try <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown"><code>blogdown</code></a>. I will share some of my experiences in using those package in this blog 😄.</p>
<p>At the moment I’m posting this, I’m still building some vignettes for <code>kerasgenerator</code>. As soon as it this finished, I will upload the link in the package website. I’m also developing some other features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for generating data from <strong>file in specified path</strong></li>
<li>Support for incorporating <a href="https://tidymodels.github.io/recipes/"><code>recipes</code></a> package for <strong>data preprocessing</strong></li>
<li>Data generator for <strong>k-shot learning</strong> model fitting</li>
</ul>
<p>If you interested in the package, please stay tuned on this blog for further post related to this package. Also don’t forget to check the package’s <a href="https://kerasgenerator.netlify.com/">website</a> and push the star buttons on the package <a href="https://github.com/bagasbgy/kerasgenerator/">GitHub repository</a> 😁</p>
<p>Happy new year!</p>
